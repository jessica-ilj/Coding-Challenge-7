# Coding-Challenge-7
This code will create a recursive function to calculate the total salary expenditure for each department in a company. The company is divided into multiple departments, and each department has employees who might be organized in a hierarchy. It will use recursion to navigate through the employees in a department and calculate the total salary expenditure for that department.
